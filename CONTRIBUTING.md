# Contributing

## What can I do?

There are several ways you can contribute:

- Improving existing guidelines.
- Creating new guidelines.
- Creating new project templates.

## How can I contribute?

The best way to contribute is following these points:

1. Discuss the changes with the maintainers.
2. Create a new branch with your changes.
3. Submit a pull request.
4. Wait for maintainers to comment or approve. If you have been waiting for an eternity, remember they are consultants as well, so they might be busy in some project; however, you can try to contact them by Teams.

The other option could be opening an issue in GitHub explaining the problem and waiting for Maintainers contribution.

## Maintainers

You can find the maintainers in the Maintainers section in the [README.md](README.md).\
Feel free to contact any maintainer for help or doubts!
